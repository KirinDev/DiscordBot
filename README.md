# DiscordBot
Creating a Discord Bot with Javascript / Node.js
Main funcionalities of the bot:
  1. Play any audio from given youtube url including even livestreams, and give information about the video aswell;
  2. Give a variety of information about an anime the user introduced.
  

1. - This funcionality will work by using the package 'play-dl'.
2. - This funcionality will work by requesting the data from an API with 'node-fetch', in this case im gonna be using KitsuAPI.
